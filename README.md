# Sentiment-Classification
Sentiment analysis and data processing

## Introduction
Using a dataset of movie reviews, the words will be curated, processed and evaluated to detect if the review is positive or negative.

The words are curated into 3 categories: positive, negative and total.

These categories are processed with ratios and then log ratios so that neutral words do not have any weight and others do.

Finally, the words, as an aggregate, are evaluated to be a positive or negative review.
